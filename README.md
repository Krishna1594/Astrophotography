# Astrophotography
Astrophotography is one of my hobbies that I enjoy. Incessant curiousity to have a closer look at them with my own eyes rather than looking at photographs on the internet put me on a journey to grab these stunning objects in space with my equipment. I have been doing this since 2018, began with my mobile device (since I couldn't afford a telescope initially) and ended having pertinent equipment for astrophotography.

This data is being recorded in a spreadsheet and continuously updated every time I picture a celestial object with my gear. The data contains how, when and at what time the celestial objects were photographed along with what equipment I used and what equipment I bought to improve my skills. The data also contains what type of celestial objects being photographed and what hurdles I faced over the years during my astrophotography.

### The Data
The Data is not well arranged. However, this encourages me to improve my data cleaning skills and validate the data as per the idea behind each column.
